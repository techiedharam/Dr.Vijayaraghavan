            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Dean IOA Colleges</h2>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">Greeting From Chennai,</h2>
           <p style="text-align: center;">
            I am writing this appeal letter after a lot of thought process. I have to bring to your kind attention that I have had the strong support from nearly 1400 Orthopaedic colleagues from across the Country every time , I have contested the IOA Election for the post of Vice President. This is due to my academic & administrative skills which people have experienced in the creation & Organisation of the Orthopaedic Association of South Indian States, a body of nearby 7500 Orthopaedic surgeons from the states of Andrapradesh , Karnataka , Kerala ,Tamil Nadu & Pondicherry & Telungana ,Functioning since 2002. Members of Tamil Nadu Orthopaedic association also have seen the strong Foundation that I helped to develop as a Joint Secretary, Secretary, vice president & president of TNOA Spanning nearly 8 years. <br> <br>
            You are all aware of my academic advancement as the vice chancellor of a premier private deemed university Sri Ramachandra Institute of Higher Education and Research (SRIHER) from
            2017-2023 after holding positions such as professor &Prof & Hod (Orthopaedics) & later Dean Education & Director (Academic Administration).I have Contributed immensely to the Erstwhile MCI & NMC as a Faculty resource for CBME development and which was introduced in august 2019 across all medical colleges .My Support base is also from the innumerable post graduates who have passed out of our institute & who are presently successful orthopaedic surgeons in their respective places in India & Abroad.
            In view of this background & being a very senior life Member of our IOA ( LM No:0312).
            I felt that I should Contribute towards the up gradation & progress of our organisation and I contested the 2016,2020 & 2022 Elections , Eveytime coming a poor second only due to the malpractices that certain coterie of individual members adapted to . In view of the litigation in 2020 , which was mainly due to the unstinting efforts of DR .Manish Dhawan & Myself , that Delhi High court went through several Hearings and In its Final order in October 2023 has invalidated the IOA Election 2020 as a Mockery due to (1) dead persons voting in the said Elections (2) Votes cast beyond the Scheduled time frame (3) Investigation report concluding out of the Emails sent to Various member in IOA asking them if they had voted in the said election and reply from 39 members that they have not voted , but their votes were recorded. The court appointed a Retried High Court Judge as an administrator & Debarred the present Executive from functioning till the new EC is Installed after 2023 Elections. Presently Administration is Carried on by the administrator with the help of an administrative committee .The expected Main Function of the IOA administration is to purify the voters list and conduct IOA Election 2023. After calling for notification & conduct Election through due process as per the constitution. <br> <br>
            Erstwhile company Ernst & Young have been given the responsibility of officially verifying IOA Member list & thereby getting the authentic vote list. This process was given 1 month
            time & has been extended. Only about 6000 members out of a possible 15000 have been verified so for & we are still awaiting the formal announcement calling for nomination of IOA Election 2023. <br>
            My Earnest request to all eligible voters to consider my genuine role in the cleanup of IOA through our litigation in Delhi High court & provide me your full support for the post of vice president for the year 2023 as and when Election 2023 are notified. <br>
